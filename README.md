2. Measures of Central Tendency – Definitions (Q2)
3. Manual Calculation of Mean, Median, Mode (Q3)
4. Levels of Measurement (Q4)
5. Variance and Standard Deviation – Theory (Q5)
6. Manual Calculation – Variance and Standard Deviation (Q6)
7. Range and Interquartile Range (IQR) (Q7)
8. Five-number Summary and Boxplot Concept (Q8)
9. Confidence Interval for the Mean (Q9)
10. Hypothesis Testing – One Sample Z-Test (Q10)
11. Dataset Guidance
12. Expected Outcomes
